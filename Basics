#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 5;

  cout << "Addition: " << a + b << endl;
  cout << "Subtraction: " << a - b << endl;
  cout << "Multiplication: " << a * b << endl;
  cout << "Division: " << a / b << endl;

  cout << "Is a greater than b? " << (a > b) << endl;

  cout << "Is a > 0 and b > 0? " << (a > 0 && b > 0) << endl;

  return 0;
}

Expected Output :- 
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2
Is a greater than b? 1
Is a > 0 and b > 0? 1
